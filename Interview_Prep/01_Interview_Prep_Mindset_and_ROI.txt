🔑 The Core Truth (Please Remember This)

	You do NOT crack product-company interviews by solving 400–500 problems.
	You crack them by mastering a small number of patterns deeply.

	The “solve 500 problems” advice is mostly for:

		Competitive programming

		Freshers with lots of time

		YouTube content creators 😅

	For an experienced full-stack engineer, solving hundreds of random problems is low ROI(Return Of Investment).
	

🔹 Why 100–150 Problems Is ENOUGH (If Done Right)

	Because interviews don’t test problem count
	They test:

		Can you identify the pattern

		Can you optimize

		Can you explain trade-offs

		Can you handle edge cases

		Can you code cleanly

		One pattern → many questions.
	
	Example:

	Sliding window pattern
		→ 15 different interview questions
		→ but same thinking


The Right Way vs Wrong Way :
❌ Wrong Way (Most People Do This)

	Watch 400 videos

	Copy solutions

	Jump between topics

	No explanation practice

	Panic in interviews

Result: “I’ve seen this question before but can’t solve it”


✅ Right Way (What We’ll Do)

For each problem:

	Identify the pattern

	Explain it out loud

	Write clean code

	Analyze time & space

	Think of variations

This builds interview muscle memory.


🔹 Interview Skills

	Interview is NOT just solving, It's about :

		Talk before coding

		Clarify constraints

		Explain approach

		Then code

		Then optimize
		


🔹 Time–Space Tradeoff Thinking

	Always think:

		Can I reduce time using space?

		Can I reduce space using time?

	Interviewers LOVE this.
	
	
🔹 Constraints Awareness

	If n <= 10^5 → O(n log n) or O(n)
	If n <= 10^7 → O(n) only
	Nested loops → always question

	This helps you instantly reject bad solutions.
