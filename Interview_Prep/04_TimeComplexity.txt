🕒 What is Time Complexity?

Time Complexity tells us:

👉 How long an algorithm takes to run as the input size increases.

It does not measure time in seconds, but in steps.


🧮 Why don't we measure actual time in seconds?

Because actual time depends on:

	CPU speed

	Laptop configuration

	Network speed

	Compiler

	Background apps

So instead of seconds, we measure steps.


🎯 Why do we need Time Complexity?

Because two pieces of code may do the same thing but one might be:

	🔥 very fast

	🐢 very slow

And you must know which one is better before writing code or going to production.


📌 Definition (Simple & Correct)
Time Complexity describes how the number of operations grows as the input size (n) grows.


🎯 Why Programmers Care?

Because understanding Time Complexity helps you choose:

	Faster algorithms

	Efficient data structures

	Better performance

	Better code for interviews

Example:

Searching in a list: O(n)

Searching in a sorted list using Binary Search: O(log n) → FAR faster
