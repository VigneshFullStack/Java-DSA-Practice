🔹 Arrays / Strings (VERY IMPORTANT)

	Patterns:

		Two pointers

		Sliding window (fixed & variable)

		Prefix sum

		Hashing (Map / Set)

		Kadane’s algorithm

		Sorting + logic

		Rotation / rearrangement

		Frequency + prefix combinations
		
		
🔹 Linked List

	Patterns:

		Slow–fast pointer

		Reverse

		Cycle detection

		Merge lists
		
		
🔹 Stack / Queue

	Patterns:

		Monotonic stack

		Next greater element

		Valid parentheses

		Sliding window maximum
		
		
🔹 Binary Search (NOT just search)

	Patterns:

		First / last occurrence

		Search on answer

		Rotated array

		Peak element
		
		
🔹 Tree

	Patterns:

		DFS / BFS

		Height / diameter

		Level order

		Path problems

		LCA
		
		
🔹 Recursion / Backtracking (Basics only)

	Subsets

	Permutations

	Combination sum
	
	

❌ What You Can SKIP (For Now)

Unless targeting FAANG hardcore roles:

	Advanced Graph algorithms

	Tries

	Segment Trees

	Heavy DP

	Bit manipulation tricks
	
⚠️ Skip for now does NOT mean skip forever. Only deprioritize until interviews are close.
