🧠 What is Space Complexity?
👉 Space Complexity tells us how much extra memory an algorithm needs to run.

Not the memory of the input…
but the additional memory the algorithm uses while solving the problem.
	

📌 Important:
Space Complexity measures ONLY extra space used by your logic, not the input itself.

Example:
If your input array has 100 elements, that memory is not counted.
But if your program creates:

	extra variables

	extra arrays

	temporary copies

	recursion stack
	then that memory is counted.
	

🧩 Why do we need Space Complexity?

Because different algorithms:

	use different amounts of memory

	perform differently on low-memory devices

	can crash if memory is not handled properly

	may need optimization

Space Complexity helps us understand how memory grows when the input grows.
